The goal of this project is to build a simulation of Conway's Game of Life that simulates Transposable Element Movement through a genome. 

Players:
Retrotransposons (RTs) - These elements will be able to self replicate and move.
DNA Transposons (DTs) - These elements will be able to move but not self replicate.
Exons - These elements will not be able to move or self replicate.

Rules:
1. If a RT or DT collides with a Exon, the simulation will end. 

Goal: 
Understand how RTs and DTs move through a genome and how they interact with each other and with exons.

## How to run the simulation
